# Contributing to Modular Computers

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## Workflow

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

## 1. Open a Pull Request

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.

## 2. Linting (LuaCheck)

Ensure your pull request passes the linting checks before asking for a review.
LuaCheck runs automatically on pull requests and the main branch to check for
common Lua mistakes. Fix any warnings or errors reported by LuaCheck before
proceeding.

## 3. Unit Testing for new functionality (mineunit)

Ensure any added functionality has written unit tests in mineunit, so we can
cover your functionality.
